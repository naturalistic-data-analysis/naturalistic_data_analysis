    "The **Sherlock** dataset contains 16 participants that watched 45 minutes of Sherlock and then verbally recalled the narrative in the scanner using a noise cancelling microphone.

    "# DataLad\n",
    "\n",
    "The easist way to access the data is using [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/), which is an open source version control system for data built on top of [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/). Think of it like git for data. It provides a handy command line interface for downloading data, tracking changes, and sharing it with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "While DataLad offers a number of useful features for working with datasets, there are three in particular that we think make it worth the effort to install for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Cloning a DataLad Repository can be completed with a single line of code `datalad clone <repository>` and provides the full directory structure in the form of symbolic links. This allows you to explore all of the files in the dataset, without having to download the entire dataset at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Specific files can be easily downloaded using `datalad get <filename>`, and files can be removed from your computer at any time using `datalad drop <filename>`. As these datasets are large, this will allow you to only work with the data that you need for a specific tutorial and you can drop the rest when you are done with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) All of the DataLad commands can be run within Python using the datalad [python api](http://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/modref.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will only be covering a few basic DataLad functions to get and drop data. We encourage the interested reader to read the very comprehensive DataLad [User Handbook](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/) for more details and troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Datalad\n",
    "\n",
    "DataLad can be easily installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install datalad`\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, it currently requires manually installing the [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/) dependency, which is not automatically installed using pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using OSX, we recommend installing git-annex using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "`brew install git-annex`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are on Debian/Ubuntu we recommend enabling the [NeuroDebian](http://neuro.debian.net/) repository and installing with apt-get.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sudo apt-get install datalad`\n",
