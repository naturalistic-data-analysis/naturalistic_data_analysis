    "For this course, we will be providing hands on tutorials working with real data using open source software written in the Python programming language. We have included some introductory tutorials in the **Background Resources** section to help you get up to speed on using [Python](https://dartbrains.org/features/notebooks/1_Introduction_to_Programming.html) and in particular how to manipulate data with [pandas](https://dartbrains.org/features/notebooks/2_Introduction_to_Pandas.html), [plot](https://dartbrains.org/features/notebooks/3_Introduction_to_Plotting.html) data, and work with [neuroimaging data](https://dartbrains.org/features/notebooks/5_Introduction_to_Neuroimaging_Data.html). All of our tutorials will be provided in the form of a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). These notebooks are distributed via a [jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) and can be downloaded to run on your personal computer.\n",

    "- [datalad](https://www.datalad.org/) - data versioning software (see Download Data tutorial for installation instructions and overview)\n",
    "- [nibabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/) - a library to read and write common neuroimaging file formats.\n",
    "- [nilearn](https://brainiak.org/) - a neuroimaging toolbox for performing statistical learning\n",

    "# Installing Software\n",
    "First, if you have never worked with Python before, we recommend installing Python via the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). This includes many popular packages used in scientific computing. Be sure to install Python 3.7. \n",
    "\n",
    "Package management in Python can be a little tricky. Anaconda has provided their own system called `conda`, which includes precompiled packages that are theoretically tested to reduce conflicts. Conda is usually a good place to start when installing packages. If a package isn't included in conda, you will next try installing the package using the Python packaging system called `pip`. This tends to be our main workhorse for installing packages. If a package isn't in PyPI, then you may have to install from a github repository. This can be done using `pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "Package installation is probably easiest through the command line in a terminal, but you can also run commands in the shell by using the `!` cell magic.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use Python for many different projects, you may find it helpful to create a [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html), which provides a way to install a specific collection of packages. This can be useful if you use different versions of the same library for different projects, or if you want to avoid conflicts across packages."

    "## Conda\n",
    "Some packages can be installed with `conda`. The more established scientific packages are already included in the anaconda distribution and usually can be installed via `conda`. The advantages of installing via `conda` is that distributions usually undergo an extra round of testing to make sure they are compatible and are precompiled. Smaller scale projects can often be installed via `conda` using a specific channel such as *conda-forge*. We have found some of the [brainiak](https://github.com/brainiak/brainiak) dependencies to be finicky to install with `pip` and instead recommend installing it with `conda`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to create a conda environment for this course, run the following command in the terminal or with a `!` in front of it within a jupyter notebook.\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create -n naturalistic python=3.7 anaconda\n",
    "```\n",
    "To activate your environment:\n",

    "If you would like would like to exit your environment:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One neat thing about `conda` environments is that you can select a specific one to serve as your kernel for a jupyter notebook. To get this to work, run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c anaconda ipykernel\n",
